# ADDARR

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/waterboy1602/addarr)](https://hub.docker.com/r/waterboy1602/addarr)

This Telegram bot makes it easy to manage your media library right from your chat. Add or delete series to [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) or movies to [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) using simple, interactive commands. You can view a full list of your series and movies, and get notified when media you've added has finished downloading.

In addition to media management, the bot also integrates with [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/), [SABnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org) and [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) to let you temporarily adjust download and upload speeds directly from the chat.

To make the bot accessible to a wider audience, it's available in multiple languages, including English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, German, French and Russian.

All commands are easily accessible through Telegram’s InlineKeyboard interface.

### Single Line Commands

Single line commands allow you to skip multiple steps of the process

- `{movie | series} {title}`: will bring you directly to the 'Is this the media you want to add' step. If you have multiple instances of Sonarr/Radarr, you will first need to select to which instance you want to add the title.  
  For example if you want to find the movie 'Godfather', you would type `movie Godfather`. To find a TV show, you need to enter `series Friends`.

## CONFIG

An example configuration file, `config_example.yaml`, is included in this repository. Copy and modify it to match your setup. Once you’ve filled in all the required fields, rename the file to `config.yaml`.

## ADMIN

You can restrict access to the following commands to admins only:

- Changing download/upload speed of Transmission, SABnzbd or qBittorrent
- List all series or movies
- Deleting a series pr movie

To enable this functionality:

1. Set the relevant admin options to true in your `config.yaml` file
2. Add admin users to `admin.txt`. You can use either their Telegram username or user ID
   - Add each admin on a separate line to avoid parsing errors

## ALLOWLIST

For stricter access control, the bot can be set to only respond to pre-approved users.

To enable this feature:

1. Set the allowlist option to true in config.yaml
1. Add allowed users to `allowlist.txt`, using their username or user ID
   - Add each user on a new line to ensure proper functionality
